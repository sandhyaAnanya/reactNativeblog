Before move on to create the react-native application, make sure all the pre-requisits like java, nodejs,android studio and an editor like vscode are installed

After all the installations are done,let us create a simple helloworld application in react-native expo cli using the command

**npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject**

application will be created

now change directory to **AwesomeProject** and run the application using the command

**npm start --tunnel**

to see the output in an Android or ios device connect your system to the Android device by downloading the **expo go** app from the play store

now scan the QR code that is generated in the terminal when u run the application
